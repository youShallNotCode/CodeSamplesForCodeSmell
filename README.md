# Code Smells Examples and Fixes

Welcome to this repository! 

The code examples contained in these files are designed to **demonstrate common code smells**-patterns in code that often indicate deeper problems affecting readability, maintainability, or performance. Each example highlights a specific code smell and provides a corresponding **refactored version** to show how to effectively fix or improve the code.

## Purpose

- Illustrate typical code smells encountered in real-world programming.
- Provide clear, practical examples of how to identify these smells.
- Showcase best practices and techniques to refactor and improve code quality.

## How to Use This Repository

- Browse through the example files to learn about different code smells.
- Compare the "before" (smelly) and "after" (clean) versions to understand the improvements.
- Use these examples as a learning tool to recognize and fix code smells in your own projects.
